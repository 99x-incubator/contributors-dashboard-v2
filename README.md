# contributors-dashboard-v2

### Requirement

The idea is to create a dashboard which will display top contributors of given Github organizations list(In our case there are two `99xt` and `99xt-incubator`). Basically, we list down the organization names and under each organization name there should be a list of constributors sorted by number of contributions. Importantly, The most important section is the final leaderboard.

Eg:

```
Contributors dashboard

Leaderboard

githubuser2     52
githubuser1     34
githubuser3     33
......


99xt                  99xt-incubator

githubuser1     34    githubuser3      33
githubuser2     12    githubuser2      30
.....

```
